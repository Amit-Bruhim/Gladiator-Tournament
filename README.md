## About

The **Gladiator Tournament** is a C program that simulates a tournament between multiple gladiators.  
Each gladiator runs as a separate process and fights opponents according to predefined data files.  

The project demonstrates **process creation (fork)**, **program execution (execv)**, and **file I/O for logging**.

## Usage

When you run the tournament program, log files for each gladiator (`log_G1.txt`, `log_G2.txt`, etc.) are created in the `logs/` directory.  
These log files show the details of each gladiator's fights.  

For this example, we will use the prepared data files in the `data/` directory, but users can modify the data there to change gladiator attributes.

After the tournament ends, the winner of the battle is printed to the terminal.
